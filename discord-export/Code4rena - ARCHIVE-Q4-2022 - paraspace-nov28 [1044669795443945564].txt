hello, I'm having an error running `make fast-tests` regarding an invalid mnemonic even though I've added a valid one to the .env file

Maybe it's related with the field `DB_PATH=:memory: #required` ? Not sure what should I put there

Is that just referencing those lines of code? For example, can we still submit a finding that is pertaining to any of those lines, but have may have similar "description heading"?


[11/29/2022 01:52] beepidibop
why does the automated findings suggest using `!= 0` instead of `>0` for gas optimization? `>0` uses less gas than `!= 0`

That will set you up to run the more verbose and lengthy `make test` I assume that's why it's different from `make fast-test`. It sure did take a while to complete.

Yes, it's weird. I also have 16, and tests are going well, but slow.

It's a node thing, not a hardhat thing per se


[11/30/2022 12:52] trust90
Thanks @LSDan ! This did the trick `export NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096` . Node versions have different default limits and mine was too low.

ParaSpace allows the user to borrow and ultimately short NFT's via NFTX's vToken. Users can thus take advantage of price declines in an NFT price.

Well, all contracts that are effectively in scope are in the scope table and I can't see it, so, no, it's not in the agreed scope 🙂


[12/07/2022 22:21] ladboy233
ok


[12/07/2022 22:39] acegawd
@Trust Dmed you.


[12/08/2022 04:02] dewaxindo
Hi, how do we run make test or make fast-test but only single file only?
do not want to run the whole testing file


[12/08/2022 04:03] dewaxindo
I try to run
`make fast-test test/_oracle_nft_floor_price.spec.ts`

but it seem still run the whole testing files

[12/08/2022 07:25] dewaxindo

The issue raised in PR https://github.com/para-space/paraspace-core/pull/7 has been already identified and evaluated, therefore, not eligible for rewards.

why this link is not accessible?

Anyone available for DM?


[12/09/2022 00:51] lsdan
I also cannot access this issue so unless the team makes it available, I'll likely consider it valid. If the team does make it available, I won't mark any reports that overlap it unsatisfactory, since it wasn't visible during the contest.


[12/09/2022 00:52] lsdan
@kartoonjoy @Dravee can we try to get at least a copy of the PR if they can't make the whole repo public?


[12/09/2022 00:54] dravee
Oh wow I'm 404 too now. @kartoonjoy, I think you'll need to ask the sponsor about it 🙏

[12/09/2022 00:55] lsdan
Ok, yeah... anything related to that PR will be nullified, not unsatisfactory


[12/09/2022 01:03] kartoonjoy
I've asked the sponsor to take a look. Hope to hear back soon. Thanks!

hello

I have a question: I can't find in the codebase what are the sensible values for `reserve.currentVariableBorrowRate`

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-paraspace/blob/3e4e2e4e1322482dcdc6d342f8799cd44a3e42f5/paraspace-core/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ReserveLogic.sol#L87

This is an `uint128`, but I would like to ask what range of values should the protocol expect


[12/09/2022 17:15] ladboy233
If the NFT is liquidated.


[12/09/2022 17:15] ladboy233
should the liqudiator receive the NFT or the NToken???


[12/09/2022 17:15] ladboy233
Please answer. Thanks.
